## General Working Rules

- **Follow development guidelines as the top priority.**
- Unless specifically requested, think and respond in English.
- Do not leave spaces in blank lines. Do not leave trailing spaces at the end of lines. Files must end with a newline character.
- Test implemented code directly or write tests using TDD approach.
- After completing work, run newly written tests or related tests.
- Check changes since the last commit using git before starting work.
- Look for similar implementations in the project first, and check with gh if related issues or PRs are mentioned.
- New features and tests should be written with minimal code, and do not make modifications beyond what was directly requested.

## Not Goals

Do not perform the following tasks unless explicitly requested:

- Code refactoring work
- Project configuration or structure changes
